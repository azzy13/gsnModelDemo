Line Tracking Module
A line tracking module is a component used in robotics and automation projects to detect lines on the ground. 
It's made up of an infrared light sensor and an infrared LED. The sensor measures the reflected infrared light 
to determine the reflectivity of a surface.The line tracing function of the car mainly uses an infrared module. 
When the sensor detects black line, the corresponding LED will light up, which controls the car to move according
to the value of three sensors.

Ultrasonic sensor
The compact ultrasonic sensor module detects objects using ultrasonic waves. The ultrasonic module
is controlled by the servo. The servo rotates to the left, middle and right repeatedly, so that the ultrasonic
module measures the distance of obstacles on the left, middle and right directions. And then it controls the
car to move according to different distances.

Server
The server works on the Raspberry Pi and can transmit camera data, ultrasonic data, etc. to the client, and it
can also receive commands from the client.

Client
The client connects to the server through TCP, which receives the video stream from the server, and other
commands. And it also sends commands to the server to control the car.
